This project focuses on developing a comprehensive, cross-platform task manager tool that combines the
essential features of Windows Task Manager, Linux Task Manager, and macOS Activity Monitor.


Built-in
Python, the tool will provide an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for system monitoring, process
management, and application interaction. By integrating the capabilities of these individual systems into a
unified platform, users will benefit from a lightweight, efficient, and functional task manager accessible
across operating systems.


#Key functionalities include:
● Resource Tracking: Monitoring CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
● Process Control: Viewing, prioritizing, and terminating processes.
● Application Management: Interacting with active applications seamlessly.
